# [2KAbhishek's Resume](./resume.pdf)

For the latest version of my resume, check out [resume.pdf](./resume.pdf).

I use [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) to write my resume, you can find the source code in [resume.tex](./resume.tex).
I generate pdfs using [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/).

The resume is also available in [markdown](./resume.md) format, this version may not be up-to-date.

Feel free to use it as a template for your own.
